    """Find comprehensive relationships for a given Home Assistant component.

    This function analyzes the relationships between the specified component and other
    Home Assistant entities, automations, and scripts. It returns a structured representation
    of how components interact with each other.

    Args:
        hass: The Home Assistant instance
        item_type: Type of item to analyze ('entity', 'automation', or 'script')
        item_id: Unique identifier of the item to analyze
        max_depth: Maximum depth for relationship traversal

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the relationship analysis results in the format:

    Definitions of terms:
        - **upstream**: Items that the specified item uses, such as entities in triggers or conditions.
          Anything that affects this item directly. For entities, this is typically empty unless
          it's a template sensor (which depends on other entities), utility meter (which depends on source entity) etc.

        - **downstream**: Items that use the specified item, such as automations or scripts that depend on it.
          Anything that is affected by this item directly.

        - **relation_type**: Indicates the type of relationship:
          - 'trigger': Item is used as a trigger (in automation triggers, or as a source for utility meters)
          - 'condition': Item is used in conditions (automation/script conditions, template sensor dependencies)
          - 'output': Item is affected/controlled by the parent (entity controlled by automation, script called by automation)

        - **max_depth behavior**:
          - At root level: Follow relationships up to max_depth levels deep
          - In nested items: Follow relationships up to max depth but only for same direction (upstream or downstream)
          - depth=0 means unlimited depth (might lead to loops in circular dependencies)

        - **Special cases**:
          - Template sensors: Entities used in template go in upstream with relation_type="condition"
          - Utility meters: Source entity goes in upstream with relation_type="trigger"
          - Automations calling scripts: Script appears in automation's downstream with relation_type="output"
          - Scripts calling other scripts: Similar to automation->script relationship

    Note:
        This is a placeholder implementation that returns an empty structure.
        The actual relationship analysis logic will be implemented later.
